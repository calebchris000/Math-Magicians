      React is a popular JavaScript library that
      has gained immense popularity among
      developers due to its simplicity and
      flexibility. One of the exciting projects
      that can be built with React is a
      calculator. A calculator built with React
      can be used for a variety of purposes,
      including performing mathematical
      operations, tracking expenses, and more.

    <p className="article">
      Building a calculator with React offers a
      modular approach to programming, allowing
      developers to create smaller, reusable
      components for the display, input fields,
      buttons, and logic. React&apos;s virtual DOM also
      enables fast rendering of changes, resulting
      in a seamless user experience.
